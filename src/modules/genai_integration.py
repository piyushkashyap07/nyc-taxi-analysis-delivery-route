    SAMPLE OUTPUT:
    Analysis indicates that late evening hours (10 PM - 2 AM) and high trip distances (>15 miles) 
    are strongly associated with longer durations, with a correlation coefficient of 0.74 between 
    distance and duration. Outlier trips exceeding 60 minutes typically occur during weekend nights 
    and show 40% higher average fares. The model identifies trip distance as the primary predictor 
    (importance: 0.68), followed by pickup hour (0.19) and pickup location (0.13).

    SAMPLE OUTPUT:
    The Random Forest model achieved R² = 0.76 with RMSE of 4.2 minutes, where trip distance 
    dominated feature importance (68%), followed by pickup hour (19%) and location IDs (13%). 
    The model showed higher prediction errors during rush hours (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM) with RMSE 
    increasing to 6.8 minutes, likely due to traffic variability. Linear regression performed 
    poorly (R² = 0.42) due to non-linear relationships between spatial-temporal features and 
    duration, while ensemble methods better captured location-specific traffic patterns.
